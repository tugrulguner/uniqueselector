Uniqueselector.py contains various subfunctions that can be used to perform
some simple tasks like removing element from array or finding index of an
element in array or sorting an array from maximum to minimum and finally 
uniquefinder(array) function at the end uses all of these subfunctions to
find unique values of array and return an array containing only unique values.

This was a fun project.
